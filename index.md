Hello! I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating with a bachelor's degree in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2

  Although Lab 2 was a simple program, it was my first time ever coding. It was one thing to learn about variables, std::cout, and std::cin in lecture. It was a whole other thing to actually put them together to take user input and print out a small text. I still remember being stuck at some point, forgetting to include strings and incorrectly declaring the string variables. Those small mistakes might seem like nothing to professionals, but to me, it was huge. And being able to fix my mistakes felt like a milestone. Despite the lab being short and simple, it managed to be my first real challenge and almost showed whether or not I was capable of coding.

* Lab 5, part 2

  What I liked about Lab 5 was the challenge it gave me at the time. In order to convert decimal feet to feet and inches, we first had to determine whether the decimal (double) was too big or small to convert. We had to use if statements, which was pretty simple and it introduced the numeric limit. Then the rest consisted of doing the right calculations to achieve the desired results. Each variable was responsible for a specific conversion or calculation that would then be part of another variable and so on. As a beginner, it definitely got me thinking and getting lost a few times during this lab, but it showed me how you have to be meticulous when creating useful programs.

* Lab 7

  This one is by far my number one favorite lab. It brought in vectors and arguments and a whole lot of boolean statements, all just to be able to determine parking availability. While I did learn how to use vectors, I overall found the lab to be very fun. It was fun writing all the boolean/if statements because it was like finding the pattern in a large picture. While it seems easy to just read a sign and check when parking is available, it was actually a brain teaser writing the statements. I had to try over and over because sometimes the if statements did not make sense. Cedar and Date street were more challenging since it included separate hours and even minutes. At some point, I had no idea what I was doing or whether I was correctly using && or ||. Still, it was a fun experience, almost like it was a game.
